# The Sum of All Containers

## Background  
Random Docker containers are showing up on your workstation. Query each one and add the values together to solve the challenge.

## Getting Started
Once Kali boots, you can `watch docker ps` to see the containers launch. Once 20 containers have deployed, you're ready to begin.

## Hints

1. It takes under 2 minutes for all the containers to deploy.
2. The containers have been added to `/etc/hosts` to ease querying them (e.g. `curl zero`).
3. To help you with Python scripting, the `num2words` package is available.

## Submission Format

Provide an integer sum of all the container values.

Example submission:  

```
12345678
```
